- 👋 Hi, I’m @EnriqueCruz, I´m a java developer 
- 👀 I’m interested in Java programming and all about backend technologies, like API, libraries, design patterns and any about Java (sooner i will learn about python). 
      Also im into english learning, despite my current level is B1, i´m decided to get me to the c2 level (i will start with this skill on next year).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Java core, i´m studying topics for the OCP 8 certification, microservices, MVC model. In front end part, i´m taking javascript courses
      and practising with some projects for getting a better understanding about javascript core, and after that, start with a framework. In the next months i would like to start with the
      python´s basics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open project with javascript, but i know by the moment my skills have to be better. About java i´m working at a 
      telecomunications company and í´m still adquiring experience through new projects.
